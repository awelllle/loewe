<p><strong>Kronach, Juli&nbsp;2022.&nbsp;For almost a century, the Loewe brand has been a symbol of inventiveness and luxury consumer electronics products. Founded in 1923, Loewe has developed into a globally operating company with a long tradition. Loewe Technology GmbH is active in 36 countries today with its high-end, elegant TV and audio products. These stand for a unique combination of German engineering, excellence, exclusive design and sustainability. The high-tech production site and the 200 employees at the headquarters in Kronach are the very heart of Loewe.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Loewe&#39;s long history, 2019 marks the beginning of a new era for the brand: Since Aslan Khabliev acquired the brand, Loewe has been an owner-managed family company, with Khabliev as both owner and CEO. As part of the acquisition, an IP holding company was founded, the so-called Loewe IP Holding, which is integrated in the renowned Skytec Group Ltd. From the very beginning, the aim was to maintain and expand the traditional manufacture and the high-tech production lines at the headquarters in Kronach. Under the name Loewe Technology GmbH, sustainable high-tech products par excellence continue to be created here &ndash; Loewe is proud that &ldquo;Engineered &amp; Made in Germany&rdquo; remains in the company&rsquo;s DNA in the new era.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A global brand</strong></p>

<p>Over the course of the last 30 months, the Loewe brand has reinvented itself: The Loewe Technology GmbH is now present in 36 markets on four continents with a wide range of TV sets and audio systems. So far, a total of 20 new products have been launched: four new TV lines (Loewe bild s, Loewe bild v, Loewe bild i, Loewe bild c), a new audio portfolio with smart radios, 3D Dolby Atmos soundbars and multi-room systems with speakers, as well as the new sub-brand We.by Loewe with a TV series and Bluetooth speakers. More than 1,800 shops worldwide carry Loewe products in their assortment; in addition, 37 Loewe Galleries have already been opened in Europe and Africa, with more in planning. In the distribution of Loewe products, the company will continue to rely on close cooperation with qualified retailers and an international partner network.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tradition at Loewe: constantly reinventing itself.</strong></p>

<p>For almost a century, the name Loewe has been a synonym for inventiveness, excellence as well as luxury-class products and experiences. Thus, the history of the Loewe brand since its founding by Siegmund and David Ludwig Loewe in Berlin in 1923 is full of impressive milestones: In 1931, together with the scientist Manfred von Ardenne, Loewe presented the first fully electronic television set, which went into series production in 1933. After the opening of the manufacturing site in Kronach in 1948, Loewe impressed the world with further pioneering achievements related to modern television. With Iris, Loewe established the first mass-produced television set on the market in 1951. In 1963, the Loewe Optaport made television entertainment mobile for the first time and, with the introduction of colour television towards the end of the 1960s, also brought it closer to reality. In the early 1980s, Loewe introduced another market innovation with the stereo television. After the advent of the Internet, Loewe presented the first smart TV in 1997.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s globally active brand is passionate and proud of its exceptional innovative strength, tradition and perfect craftsmanship &ldquo;Made in Germany&rdquo;. The soon to be 100 years old history continues with a clear focus on the luxury segment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Made in Germany&ldquo; from Kronach</strong></p>

<p>With its headquarters and manufacturing site in Kronach, Loewe remains firmly rooted in Germany. Every Loewe television is designed and developed in Kronach. Furthermore, all OLED TV sets and selected LCD TVs are manufactured there as well. Loewe is thus clearly committed to its heritage. The pioneering spirit and many years of experience of the Loewe experts in the development of innovative technology, together with the unique Loewe design, continue to be the DNA of the brand.</p>

<p>Producing in Germany on the basis of the manufacturing concept enables a high level of adaptability: in contrast to mass production, Loewe focuses on individuality and flexibility of the product concepts. This facilitates responding quickly to market requirements, including customer-specific offerings &ndash; such as colours.</p>

<p>From the conception of the aesthetic design through the development of hardware and software to the construction, prototyping and final assembly of the TVs, all steps of development are concentrated in Kronach. For every manufacturing process, Loewe uses high-precision equipment and applies strict testing procedures to guarantee absolute perfection. This includes, for example, the exact colour calibration of the TVs: every Loewe TV is calibrated to the highest precision for the most realistic and beautiful colours. This process of colour matching is a very complex procedure, which is outstanding in the industry.</p>

<p>Loewe stands for the best German engineering not only with televisions, but also in the audio segment. For instance, the new Loewe klang sub1 wireless subwoofer that can be directly connected to the TV is innovatively designed so that it offers absolutely vibration- and latency-free sound output, despite its ultra-compact size. It is therefore one-of-a-kind on the market.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Long-term climate protection</strong></p>

<p>Loewe is committed to creating beautifully designed, highly functional, modern and timeless products. By selecting only the finest and highest quality materials, Loewe&#39;s meticulous precision work results in sustainable products that impress with their energy efficiency, software updates and ability to be repaired for years to come, thus emphasising the Loewe sustainability concept. This also includes reusable transport packaging and recyclable packaging materials, which have been standard at Loewe for a long time. Sustainable materials, environmentally friendly cardboard packaging and reusable textile materials as well as printing inks based on plant oil are primarily used for this purpose. An equally important component of Loewe&#39;s sustainability concept is the source of energy: Loewe&#39;s production already runs on 100 percent green electricity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A new century of excellence</strong></p>

<p>In the new Loewe century from 2023, the brand will remain committed to its roots and will continue to sustainably shape the TV and audio segments as a driver of innovation. In addition, the product range will be further diversified: The strategic orientation will also include excellent products in the luxury segment in the future, such as in the fields of indulgence and e-mobility. An outstanding fully automated coffee machine and an exceptional electric scooter are already scheduled for market launch in 2023. Moreover, further product categories are already in development to be introduced in the next few years.</p>

<p>The expert combination of technical masterpieces and elegant design icons will remain the hallmark in the new product segments &ndash; thus establishing Loewe as the reference for luxury in an increasingly diversified portfolio worldwide.</p>

<p>The Loewe Technology GmbH is going to maintain the aspiration of constantly reinventing itself while continuing the culture of tradition, superior craftsmanship and technological development in every aspect of creating luxury experiences par excellence. To be able to strengthen these values in the future, Loewe is building a new headquarters in Kronach with a new office building including an expanded technology centre, new production facilities and the creation of jobs.</p>

<p>Alongside this, the focus is on expanding the global presence by intensifying valuable relationships with existing and new partners and strengthening brand visibility in selected sales channels. Loewe will invest in all points of customer interaction, from visibility at the point of sale through online presence to customer service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Successfully into the future</strong></p>

<p>The Loewe Technology GmbH is entering the future with a long-term strategy: The Loewe brand will, now more than ever, stand for luxurious and sustainable devices providing superior and uncompromisingly high quality products and services. The specialised knowledge of the experienced engineers at the headquarters as well as powerful strategic technology partnerships and &quot;Made in Germany&quot; will continue to create unique design icons with superior functionality. It is Loewe&rsquo;s aspiration to achieve perfection with the industry&#39;s highest-quality components.</p>

<p>The new strategic plan has already been reflected in the business results: turnover grew by more than 50% in 2021 compared to 2020. This trend also continued in the first quarter of 2022 with significant growth on a comparable basis to 2021. The operating result has been at a high level since then.</p>
