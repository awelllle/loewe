<p><strong>Kronach, Mai&nbsp;2022. Loewe Technology continues to expand its audio portfolio by introducing the Loewe </strong><strong>klang sub1</strong><strong>. The compact subwoofer provides a dynamic, powerful bass foundation and thus complements both the integrated audio solutions of Loewe TV sets (from SL3) and those of third-party suppliers (with audio output controlled simultaneously with the TV). The design of the innovative subwoofer, developed at the company&#39;s headquarters in Kronach, enables a very compact format, a wireless connection to the TV and vibration-free sound output. As a result, the Loewe klang sub1 blends discreetly into any room.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The compact Loewe klang sub1 surprises with a total music output of a powerful 160 watts. This guarantees first-class cinema sound at home and a thrilling music experience, made possible by the innovative design inside the subwoofer: Underneath the luxurious chassis, the Loewe acoustics experts have combined four free-swinging passive cones with two active bass speakers in the shape of a hexagon. This driver arrangement means that the Loewe klang sub1 is absolutely vibration-free, even at high volumes, and eliminates the noise that often accompanies it. At the same time, this design enables a construction that is around 50 percent smaller than conventional woofer designs &ndash; with the same performance. As a result, the Loewe klang sub1 has dimensions of just 287 x 287 x 158 mm (width x height x depth).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not only cinema and music enthusiasts who will love the immersive and precisely balanced Loewe klang sub1. Also design lovers will get their kicks with the new subwoofer. Consequently, the developers rely on a high-quality selection of materials and give the elegantly shaped powerhouse an unique look, which is further emphasised by the elegant surrounding acoustic fabric and the solid base and ceiling panels. The elegant design is rounded off by refined detail solutions such as the power cable, whose plug runs invisibly into the base of the woofer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Loewe klang sub1 picks up on essential Loewe brand values: the sound is precisely matched to the acoustic characteristics of Loewe products, while design language and materials harmonise perfectly with the current portfolio. For a convenient installation and an interference-free sound transmission between TV and woofer, Loewe relies on a wireless high-performance connection. In this way, the Loewe klang sub1 enables both movie nights with thrilling cinema sound and brilliant concert experiences in the living room. Thereby, the subwoofer can be positioned almost everywhere in the room to be integrated harmoniously into the interior design. Especially in smaller rooms, the new bass specialist presents itself as a high-performance upgrade for a thrilling cinema and concert experience thanks to its combination of compact construction, consistent design and rich sound output up to just beneath 100 Hertz.</p>
